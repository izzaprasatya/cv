                <p>October 2024 - December 2024</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Conducted hydrological analysis using ArcGIS Pro to model hydrological parameters, such as sink-filled elevation,
                        flow direction, flow accumulation, and catchment areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Analyzed elevation, relief, two-dimensional area, three-dimensional area, and their differences in six of the watersheds
                        that were generated.

                        landcover in the study area and assess its albedo properties in relation to solar radiation and season change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculated the Urban Heat Island effect using Landsat 8 satellite images captured during the winter of 2022
                        (December 2021 - March 2022) and the summer of 2022 (June 2022 - September 2022).

                    <li>
                        Analyzed the differences in landcover changes between winter and summer, as well as the variations in Urban Heat Island values
                        influenced by different land cover types.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calculated the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) in Bursa City Center to evaluate the ecological parameters that are
                        beneficial for urban planning.
